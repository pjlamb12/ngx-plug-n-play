<h1>ngx-plug-n-play Angular Library</h1>

<p>
	The <code>ngx-plug-n-play</code> library is an Angular library that contains services, components, directives,
	pipes, etc that are easily implemented into any project. The goal is to provide functionality while not defining any
	default styles. Directives don't provide a template, so those will inherently use the styles defined by the user.
	Components will use ng-template, ng-content, and other forms of transclusion so that the user can style components
	to match their application.
</p>
