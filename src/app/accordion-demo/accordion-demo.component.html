<h1>Accordion Component Demo</h1>
<pnp-accordion>
	<ng-container accordion-header>
		<button class="btn btn-primary accordion-trigger mb-2">Open</button>
	</ng-container>
	<div class="card" accordion-body>
		<p class="card-body">Here is the content of the accordion dropdown.</p>
	</div>
</pnp-accordion>

<p>
	The <code>AccordionModule</code> contains one component, the <code>AccordionComponent</code>. It uses content
	projection to provide a trigger to open and close the accordion, and the body of the accordion. The parent
	component, the one implementing the accordion, thus determines all the styles for the component.
</p>

<p>
	When the <code>.accordion-trigger</code> is clicked, an Angular animation is triggered to either scroll up or scroll
	down to show the <code>.accordion-body</code>.
</p>

<p>The <code>AccordionComponent</code> has one <code>Input</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>triggerSelector: string</code> &mdash; This is the CSS class selector for the accordion trigger. It
		defaults to <code>.accordion-trigger</code>. If no projected content element has the same class, then a class
		inside the <code>AccordionComponent</code> is used as the trigger, <code>.accordion-header-container</code>.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The component has one <code>Output</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>isCollapsedUpdated: EventEmitter&lt;boolean&gt;</code>: &mdash; The <code>Output</code> emits true or
		false, letting the parent component know if the accordion is open or not. That way the parent component can
		change its display in some way depending on the status. It doesn't need to change the visibility of the
		<code>[accordion-body]</code>, but maybe an icon or something like that.
	</li>
</ul>
