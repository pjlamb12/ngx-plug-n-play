<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	The dropdown component allows a user to provide any dropdown trigger they'd like, and handles the toggling of the
	dropdown. The user also determines if the dropdown is ever hidden or not. If you want, you could always have it
	showing. The implementing developer also takes full control of the UI. The dropdown component itself doesn't apply
	any styles at all. Via content projection, you should provide one element with an attribute of
	<code>dropdown-trigger</code> and a template variable of <code>#dropdownTrigger</code>, and another element of
	available options with an attribute of <code>dropdown-options</code> and a template variable of
	<code>#dropdownOptions</code>. If these aren't provided, things won't be set up properly.
</p>

<p>
	There is one input to the component, <code>closeOnOuterClick</code>. This makes it so that if the dropdown is open
	and the user doesn't click on the dropdown, it will close (without selecting a new item, obviously).
</p>

<p>
	There are two outputs from the component as well: <code>updateShowResults</code> and
	<code>dropdownItemSelected</code>. <code>updateShowResults</code> emits a boolean of whether the dropdown should be
	open or closed. It starts with a value of false, and then toggles back and forth from there.
	<code>dropdownItemSelected</code> emits the index and the text of the newly selected item. You can use those to
	update the UI.
</p>

<p>
	There's a function in the dropdown utility file to select the correct item from your list of options if you're
	hiding the currently selected item. If you don't hide the currently selected item, you don't need to worry about it.
	If you do want to hide the currently selected item, use the <code>getRealItemFromListAfterSelection</code> function
	from the dropdown utility file. It will return the actual item from the list for you.
